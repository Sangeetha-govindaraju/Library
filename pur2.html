Description - Programming is about polishing the craft with years of trial and error. I wish there was a way to save yourself from all the hard work by learning from the mistakes of other programmers? Fortunately, there is, and it is known to the world as the Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship book from the legendary Uncle Bob.
The clean code offers invaluable insights into code cleaning and software development. It has thorough, step-by-step explanations on cleaning, writing, and refactoring code. The programming book has a galore of practical examples about the how and why of writing clean code.

Post successful completion of the Clean Code book, you will be able to effortlessly implement Agile methodology, one of the leading forms of SDLC, in your software development projects. Also, you will find yourself to be a more resolute, disciplined programmer than before.

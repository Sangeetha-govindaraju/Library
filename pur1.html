<br>Description - The name of the book is self-explanatory. It is what the title suggests, i.e., Introduction to Algorithms. Also known as CLRS, a reference to the last name of the authors of the book, it goes in-depth into a range of algorithms divided across several self-contained chapters.

All the algorithms discussed in the Introduction to Algorithms book are amply explained. They are presented using pseudocode, readable by programmers of all skill levels, even those who are relatively new to programming.
